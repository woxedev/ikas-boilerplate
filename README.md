# Ikas App Boiler Plate

This is a boilerplate for creating a new Ikas app. It includes the basic structure of an Ikas app and provides a simple example of how to interact with the Ikas API.

Please note that this boilerplate does not include permission checks or error handling, so be sure to configure your app accordingly.
